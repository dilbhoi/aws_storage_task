# 🗂️ Internship Task 1 – AWS Cloud Storage Setup

This repository contains documents and analysis files from **Task 1** of my cloud computing internship. The objective was to create, configure, and secure an AWS S3 bucket with sample uploads and access policies.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Create and configure an S3 bucket (`dilbhoiinternship`)
- Upload test files and documents
- Configure bucket policy and public access permissions
- Verify object-level access via direct URLs
- Understand network-level DNS and HTTP behaviors via Wireshark

## 📁 Files Uploaded

| File Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `DNS 1 and DNS2.pdf`             | Step-by-step DNS analysis using Wireshark |
| `HTTP Wireshark Analysis.pdf`    | HTTP GET/OK packet capture, timings, and script for CSV parsing |
| `tcp packet.pdf`                 | TCP 3-way handshake, segment tracking, and RTT analysis using Wireshark |

These files were also uploaded to the S3 bucket and validated through browser-based object links.
